My Coding Practice Repository

🚀 Welcome to my code learning playground! This repository is where I experiment with various programming concepts, tackle challenges, and improve my skills.

📌 Overview
	This repo contains implementations of different programming topics, including:
	- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Binary Search)
	- Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples)
	- Python Functions (lambda, recursion, comprehensions)
	- File Handling (Reading/Writing files)
	- Error Handling & Debugging
	- Miscellaneous Experiments 🚀
	Each folder or file in the repository represents a different concept or coding challenge.
	🛠 Installation & Usage
	- Clone this repository:
	git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
	- Navigate to the project directory:
	cd your-repo
	- Run Python scripts:
	python filename.py


📖 Learning Approach
	- ✅ I follow best practices and iterate on code improvements.
	- ✅ I document findings and code explanations in each script.
	- ✅ Some implementations include challenges and optimizations.
	
💡 Future Plans
	🔹 Expand into advanced algorithms
	🔹 Explore machine learning basics
	🔹 Create interactive scripts for hands-on learning
